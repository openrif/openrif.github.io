OpenRIF is an open source community devoted to developing and
promoting interoperable and extensible semantic infrastructure for
scholarship.

OpenRIF community members currently work on various semantic
infrastructure components: 

- [VIVO-ISF](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/VIVO-ISF+Ontology) for representing people, works and the relationships of
  people and works eagle-i for representing research resources, and
  the relationship of those resources to people and their works
- [SciENcv](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/), the federal researcher profile and biosketch infrastructure
- PARDI, the NIH Portfolio Analysis and Reporting Data Infrastructure,
  for research impact and evaluation
- Attribution for many types of contributions across a wide spectrum of scholarship

OpenRIF seeks to align with other information representation efforts
in scholarship to insure scalable/exchangeable information
infrastructure for scholarship.  Such related efforts include [ORCiD](http://orcid.org/),
[SHARE](http://www.share-research.org/), [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/), [NIH BD2K](https://datascience.nih.gov/bd2k), [LD4L](https://www.ld4l.org/), [EuroCRIS](http://www.eurocris.org/) and others. OpenRIF relies
on existing semantic infrastructure such as obo, bfo, foaf, skos, and
others to contribute to a growing effort to share semantics across
domains.
