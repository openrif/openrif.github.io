It's August!  Seems like a good time for another OpenRIF update.

## Attribution of Contributions in Open Source Communities

Members of the OpenRIF community may find Kate McLaughlin's presentation from PyCon 2016, 
[Build a Better Hat Rack: All Contributions 
Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAu7Xw9lFt0) of interest.  This talk focuses on the 
[#LABHR movement](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23labhr), 
[started](https://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/) by [Leslie 
Hawthorn](https://twitter.com/lhawthorn).  LABHR describes a five-step process to identify and 
thank, both privately and publicly, non-code contributions.  There is a strong analogy to 
issues in academia around attributing non-authorship contributions to science.  Compare and 
contrast!

## VIVO 2016 Conference Posters

Both of our poster submissions for the [VIVO 2016 conference](http://www.vivoconference.org/) 
were accepted.  If you'll be in attendance, come talk to Marijane about OpenRIF and the 
SciENcv alignment to the VIVO-ISF ontology during the poster reception on August 17th from 
5-7pm.

## VIVO for Historical Persons at VIVO 2016

Thea Lindquist and Alex Viggio invited Marijane to help out with the ontology extensions for 
their VIVO for Historical Persons project, http://vivo4hp.org.  The model was extended to 
accommodate diplomatic missions and historical dates.  VIVO4HP will be a featured presentation 
at VIVO 2016 on August 18th. OWL files and ontology diagrams can be found at the OpenRIF 
github: https://github.com/openrif/vivo4hp

Look for an OpenRIF blog post going into more detail soon.

## ICBO 2016 Conference Poster

We managed to sneak the SciENcv/VIVO-ISF poster into the [ICBO 2016 
conference](http://icbo.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/), happening this week Aug 1-4 in Corvallis, OR 
on the Oregon State University campus.  See it during one of the many poster sessions 
scheduled throughout the conference.
