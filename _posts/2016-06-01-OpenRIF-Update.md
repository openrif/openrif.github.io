It's June!  A lot has been happening in the OpenRIF community since I joined in February.  An 
update seems in order.

## OpenRIF workshop at FORCE2016

Members of the OpenRIF community successfully conducted a workshop at FORCE2016 in April.  [A 
recap has been posted at the OpenRIF 
Blog](http://www.openrif.org/2016/04/29/FORCE2016-Workshop-Recap.html). Which brings us to...

## Blogging

We have begun occasionally posting content to the [OpenRIF blog](http://www.openrif.blog/).  In addition to updates like 
the one you are reading now, over the summer there will be a series of posts rehashing 
presentations from the workshop at FORCE2016.  Links to blog posts will be posted to the 
[OpenRIF Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenRIF).

## VIVO User Group Meeting

Members of the OpenRIF community were in attendance at the VIVO User Group Meeting in Chicago 
on May 5th and 6th.  A productive and stimulating discussion about ontology change management 
occurred on the second morning of the meeting, and it ended with an list of action items that 
includes the creation of an ontology development process, which will be addressed in more 
detail in at least one future blog post.  [A more detailed recap can be found at the VIVO 
Blog](http://vivoweb.org/vivo-updates-may-8-2016-vivo-user-group-meeting).

## OpenRIF on Gitter

A handful of OpenRIF chat rooms were created on Gitter, most within the last two weeks.

* [http://gitter.im/openrif/community](http://gitter.im/openrif/community) is intended to be a complement to the 
[openrif-community Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrif-community) 
and our [community repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openrif/community), which is where 
members of the community can submit requests and issues related to VIVO-ISF.  This is a good 
place to ask questions about OpenRIF.

* [http://gitter.im/openrif/vivo-isf-ontology](http://gitter.im/openrif/vivo-isf-ontology) is for discussion of all things related to the 
VIVO-ISF ontology.

* [http://gitter.im/openrif/www.openrif.org](http://gitter.im/openrif/www.openrif.org) is for contributors to the OpenRIF website.

* [http://gitter.im/openrif/sciencv-integration](http://gitter.im/openrif/sciencv-integration) is for community members working on the SciENcv 
integration project.

* [http://gitter.im/openrif](http://gitter.im/openrif) is a private chat room for members of the [OpenRIF organization 
on GitHub](https://github.com/openrif). (Email [mailto:whimar@ohsu.edu](Marijane White) if you 
would like an invite to join our GitHub organization.)

## VIVO 2016 Conference Poster Submissions

We took advantage of the extended poster submission deadline for VIVO 2016 to submit a [poster 
abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qqFkGpv5qeGp9wHCdQuDEuC1IQpGhLQ7mSNqubAAFCI/edit) 
about OpenRIF.  Marijane White also submitted a [poster 
abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm64NColKprFkTVQHj-1wNt_kLHj8P8-5R-MY7oh68k/edit) 
about the SciENcv/VIVO-ISF integration project.

## Google Group Housekeeping

The two OpenRIF Google Group mailing lists were reorganized this week.  The group formerly 
known as "openrif" is now 
"[openrif-community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrif-community)" and will be 
used as a place to post updates like the one you are reading now and a place to ask questions 
about OpenRIF.  The group formerly known as "openrif-team" is now known as 
"[openrif-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrif-dev)" and is the place to go to 
talk about things like tools, process, ontology changes, documentation, website updates, and 
conference participation -- in other words, any and all of the work done by the OpenRIF 
community. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrif-dev
